    """
    Applies a sub-pixel spatial shift to an input array using the Fourier shift theorem.

    This function computes the Fourier transform of the input array, applies a phase
    shift corresponding to the desired translation along the specified axes, and then
    computes the inverse Fourier transform to obtain the shifted array. The appropriate
    FFT routines are chosen based on whether the input array is real-valued or
    complex-valued.

    Parameters
    ----------
    array : A real- or complex-valued input array.
        The array to be shifted.
    shift : A 1D array of shift values.
        Each element corresponds to the desired shift along the respective axis.
        Its length must equal the number of axes along which the shift is applied.
        (By default, all axes of the input.)
    axes : A tuple of integers, optional.
        The axes along which to apply the shift. If None, the shift is applied to
        all axes of the array.

    Returns
    -------
    shifted : A real- or complex values array
        The shifted array, having the same shape and data type as the input array.

    Raises
    ------
        AssertionError: If the length of the shift array does not match the number
        of axes specified.

    Notes
    -----
    - When the input array is real-valued, the function uses the real FFT
        (rfftn and irfftn) to optimize performance. For complex arrays, the standard
        FFT (fftn and ifftn) is used.
    - The phase shift is computed as:
            exp(-2Ï€j * (frequency_grid @ shift))
        and is applied in the Fourier domain.

    """
    Identify shifts that register subvolumes along a specified axis.

    The computation can be executed in one of three modes:
      - "low_memory": Loads one volume at a time (minimal memory footprint, default).
        This is possible and helpful because of the way nibabel's ArrayProxy works.
      - "vectorized": Loads all volumes in memory and uses JAX vectorization (vmap).
      - "threaded": Loads all volumes in memory and tries to threaded across
        available devices (GPUs or CPU threads, depending on jax config, see below).
        If enough threads are available, it assigns one subvolume to each otherwise
        falling back to vmap.

    Additionally, once the data is loaded in the memory, an optional `combine_fn`
    is applied over `combine_axes` which may further reduce the data size
    (e.g. by applying SoS channel combination)

    Parameters
    ----------
    array : np.ndarray, jnp.ndarray, or nib.arrayproxy.ArrayProxy
        Array which will be registered along `axis`.
    ref : int, default = -1
        Index of the reference volume along the subvolume axis.
    axis : int, default = -1
        Axis which will be subdivided; each subvolume along this axis will be
        registered against `array.take(ref, axis)`.
    upsample_factor : int, default = 100
        Upsampling factor for subpixel registration accuracy.
        Images will be registered to within `1 / upsample_factor` of a pixel.
        For example `upsample_factor == 20` means the images will be registered
        within 1/20th of a pixel. The default (100) may be overly zealous.
    execution_mode : str, default = "vectorized"
        Execution mode: one of "low_memory", "vectorized", or "threaded".
    combine_fn : Callable[[Array], Array]
        Optional function, mapping array to an array, to reduce dimensions that are
        irrelevant for registration, e.g. by applying a channel combination.
        Note, that it must operate on _indexed_ arrays, i.e. with ndim of array.ndim - 1

    Returns
    -------
    shifts : Float[Array, "nvol ndim"]
        Array of necessary shifts, stacked along the leftmost dim over all volumes.
        Each shift has a length equal to the volume's dimensionality.

    Notes
    -----
    - If installed with a GPU support, jax will try to use GPUs if available.
      If no GPU is found, it will default to use the CPU. (This can also be controlled
      by setting `JAX_PLATFORM_NAME` environment variable to `gpu` or `cpu`.)
    - By default, JAX sees a CPU, however many threads there is, as a single device.
      In this case execution_mode="vectorized" will attempt to use all available threads
      _when possible_, e.g. when performing FFT due to its underlying vectorisation.
    - If you have sufficient number of threads, you may want to force jax to treat each
      threat as a separate device and `pmap` over them (running the entire subvolume
      processing on a single thread). To do this simply set execution_mode="threaded"
      and the code will set the number of devices to the number of threads automatically.
      In my limited testing, I observed that forcing the device count to the max number
      proves marginally more beneficial than setting it to the exact number of echoes.
